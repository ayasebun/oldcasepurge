# oldcasepurge
Script used explicitly for work for removing old log directories with a certain naming convention.

This was made in conjunction with [hcuparser](https://github.com/ayasebun/hcuparser) given that I went through many sets of data in a day.

This is also why it has an option to just not run if ran incorreectly.
